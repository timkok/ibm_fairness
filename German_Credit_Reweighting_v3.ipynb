Supervised machine learning has equipped systems to make predictions for new instances. The predicted values are driven by the model developed by trying to understand and devise a pattern in the training data in terms of the protected attributes.\n","\tThe systems fairness in making the prediction is thus dependent on the model and in turn the training data that has been provided to the generate the model. The issue in training data maybe insufficient data to make unbiased decision and or generating a prediction model which introduces bias in the system on specific attributes.\n","The credit decision pipeline is trained by the german credit data instances. The pipeline is inspected for bias on age as the protected attribute. An age of over ‘25’ is privileged with positive outcome while age less than ‘25’ is unprivileged. Following the machine learning pipeline, the instances are first divided into training and testing dataset. The model and prediction is then tested for bias in the credit decision by comparing the decision for privileged and unprivileged group. The process has dropped another protected attribute gender from the training dataset to reduce the influence of gender on the model and hence the prediction. \n","\tBinary Label dataset metric has been used to classify the training data as favorable and unfavorable for the protected attribute ‘age’. The mean difference in the outcomes of the two groups clearly indicates that a positive outcome of credit decision is 17% more likely for a privileged group with age >25. \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"jtmyS90-6Zyc","colab_type":"text"},"source":["The entire process of the bias mitigation can be explianed as a process in  involving the following steps\n","\n","1.
